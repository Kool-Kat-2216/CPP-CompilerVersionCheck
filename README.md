# C++ Compiler Version Check
A simple program I wrote in **C++** to check the compiler and compiler version the program is running on. This can be extremely useful when you have installed a new compiler and have to check it's version.

This currently supports **`GCC (GNU Compiler Collection)`**, **`Clang++`**, **`Visual Studio`**, and **`ICC (Intel C++ Compiler)`**.

Let me know if there are any bugs. Thanks!
